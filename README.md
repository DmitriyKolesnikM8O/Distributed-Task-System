A small home project for training in microservice architecture and writing applications in Golang.



## Features 

- The whole project and all parts are raised in Docker
- PostgreSQL is used as the database
- Redis is used as a cache
- There are 2 microservices: CRUD for tasks and a service for authorization
- JWT tokens are used in Cookies for security
- All logs and other information are displayed in Grafana, collected using Prometheus
- Microservices communicate through REST
- The project is executed using Clean Architecture, separation of levels, abstractions
- Some parts of the code are covered by unit testing
- Users and Tasks stores in different tables


## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Golang - Backend
- PostgreSQL - DB
- Redis - Cache 
- Prometheus/Grafana - logs, metrics
- Docker - launch
- REST API - A means of communication for microservices
- Clean Code - Architecture Style
- 2 Tables - For task and for users

API Endpoints:

- api-gateway service

  - **GET TASK BY ID:** GET localhost:8080/task/{id}
  - **CREATE TASK:** POST localhost:8080/task
  - **UPDATE TASK BY ID:** PUT localhost:8080/task/{id}
  - **DELETE TASK BY ID:** DELETE localhost:8080/task/{id}
- auth-service service
  
   - **LOGIN:** POST localhost:8081/login
   - **SIGNUP:** POST localhost:8081/signup

You can send the data in the request body. For more information, see the code. A response is returned for each request. If the error is an explanation of why it occurred

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone (https://github.com/DmitriyKolesnikM8O/distributed_task_system)
cd distrubuted_task_system
```

2. Assembling images of each of the microservices

```sh
cd api-gateway
docker build -t prod-service:local . 
cd ..
cd auth-service
docker build -t prod-service:local . 
```

3. Launching docker containers

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

After that, the entire application will be launched
